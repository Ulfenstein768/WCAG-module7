## General Information

#### Name:

Úlfur Þór Böðvarsson.

#### Description for project 7:

For this Guide the students choose a subject according to their interests to research and work on individual projects under the guidance of an instructor. The main point of this project is to experiment with future technological innovations in web development.

I chose the topic of making the web more accessible for people with a form of disability, that prevents them from using some websites and / or need some sort of help if they want to browse the web.
So the subject for this project is:

How can we make a WCAG 2.1 compliant website?

## Tech-Stack

The technology used in this project are only:

- HTML
- CSS
- Figma
- Google Lighthouse
- NVDA (Screen reader)
- Wave (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)

## Research results

Back in module 3, we did an assignment on accessibilty, but really no other themed assignment regarding the topic of accessibility when creating websites. The thought of that did not really occur to me again until the presentation of our last assignment, when we showcased our product and one of the industry professionals asked us a question, that sounded; "Does the orange font color have enough color contrast in comparison to the background?" When designing our product, we did not even think to checkout if the color contrast was enough, so that it was visible for people who have it harder to focus on colors.

This got me thinking. Why are we not all focusing on this concept since there is such a huge portion of the world having some form of disability or people having difficulties seeing colors or suffer from essential tremor or other diseases making it hard for them to use the web. The web should be for everyone, but some tend to forget that sometimes. Making the web accessible is not a requirement, but it is a good practice, so that everyone can be a part of this hugely reliant thing that ever keeps evolving. We humans are becoming more and more reliant on the web, since most of the services today are done online. Calling a support center is not a thing anymore, so people need to know how to use the internet now and that can be hard for people if it is not coded and or designed correctly.

When I started my research I really did not know what to search for or where the most relevant information could be found. Googling page after page I found some bits and pieces that were good practice, but never really knowing where to start or what the finished product would be. Finding the WCAG guideline website and the a11y (accessibility, (A and then 11 letters before the I, funny way to spell it.)) website, was great help. Where the WCAG website kind of works like a stack overflow, where there are solutions to how to execute a certain problem, when it comes to compliance in making web, and the ally website has great articles and resources that I could checkout to learn more and get inspired by.
Having a good talk with Baldur at Blindrafélagið was also a great help. We talked about many things and what key points were important to focus on.

There are four principals that fall under the WCAG guideline success criteria.
They are:

- Perceivable
  - components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
- Operable
  - User interface components and navigation must be operable.
- Understandable
  - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
- Robust
  - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

After massive amounts of articles read I concluded that the best way to approach this project was to create a prototype, or atleast some form of colors, that match a certain contrast level. Fonts that would be relatively easy to read and a type-scale to make sure the fonts would be big enough to read.

(I know that by not making a prototype is stupid, because it gets messy when coding from your head, but since the research was so big for this project I had to start coding
something, otherwise there would not be enough time to finish the project.)

When all the design choosing was done for the site, I decided that I also wanted to make it so, that a screen reader could be use to read through the website, while also making the website keyboard accessible. I really wanted to make my product fall into all the four criterias listed above.

I thought it would be funny to do a fictional restaurant type of website, since ordering food online can often be problematic if forms or selection items are often not fully optimised for people who have a form of disability. In my opinion the code is structured so that by looking at it, it is possible to work from it, having clear and simple examples when coding HTML to make the code compliant.

Looking back I found many great practices and altough there are a lot of things to keep in mind, when making make digital accessibility easier, I wanted to create some concrete examples that show good examples and maybe even spark interest in this field.
